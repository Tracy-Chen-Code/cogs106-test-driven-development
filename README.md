Signal Detection Theory II: Experiments and ROC Curves
In this assignment, we will extend the Signal Detection Theory (SDT) implementation to handle multiple conditions and analyze performance across an experiment. Specifically, we will:

Implement an Experiment class that stores multiple SDT objects.
Compute the ROC curve and AUC (Area Under the Curve) for an entire experiment.
Add appropriate unit tests to verify the functionality.
